## Get your client secrets

**Note**: You will need to have created a Client ID in your [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/console) before proceeding.

- Click the name of a Client ID to view that ID and download JSON</li>
- Create a new file called `client_secrets.json` in the same directory as source files.

# Run

The samples in this directory uses the built in `sample_tools` utility of the Google APIs Python client to build an API service from the discovery document that you downloaded, and authenticate the user with OAuth.
